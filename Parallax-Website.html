            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change is generally defined as a significant variation of average weather 
                conditions say, conditions becoming warmer, wetter, or drier over several decades 
                or more. It's the longer term trend that differentiates climate change from natural 
                weather variability.</p>

                Weather describes the conditions outside right now in a specific place. For example, if you 
                see that it's raining outside right now, that's a way to describe today's weather. Rain, 
                snow, wind, hurricanes, tornadoes - these are all weather events.<br><br>
                Climate, on the other hand, is more than just one or two rainy days. Climate describes the weather 
                conditions that are expected in a region at a particular time of year. <br><br>Is it usually rainy or 
                usually dry? Is it typically hot or typically cold? A region's climate is determined by observing 
                its weather over a period of many years - generally 30 years or more.

        <h3>Evidences of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial 
                advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern 
                climate era and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's
                orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.<br><br>The current warming trend is of particular significance 
                because it is unequivocally the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented 
                over millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread and rapid 
                changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.<br><br>Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological 
                advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its
                climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.

                    <h4>1. Global Temperature Rise</h4>
                    <p>The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) 
                        since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere 
                        and other human activities. Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years 
                        being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.

                    <p>
                        Improvements to energy efficiency and vehicle fuel economy, increases in wind and solar power, biofuels from 
                        organic waste, setting a price on carbon, and protecting forests are all potent ways to reduce the amount of 
                        carbon dioxide and other gases trapping heat on the planet.

                    <p>Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, 
                        however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.

                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>
                        One solution is constructing seawalls. These barriers are often built to a height of five to six feet above sea 
                        level. When seawalls age or become damaged from constant exposure to saltwater or the impact of waves, they need 
                        to be replaced. They also need to be replaced or built higher as sea levels continue to rise. Protect wetlands. 
                        Wetlands act as natural buffers for coastal areas during rainstorms and hurricanes. They absorb precipitation and 
                        storm surge waters. Learn about wetland restoration activities in your area and get involved.

                    <p>The ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming 
                        of more than 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969. Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>
                        ocean is ripe with opportunities to reduce carbon pollution including installing offshore wind turbines, expanding the 
                        use of floating wind and solar facilities, decarbonizing the shipping industry, protecting and restoring mangroves and 
                        seagrasses, shifting diets to sustainable marine sources, and exploring carbon storage potential under the seabed.

                        show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about

                        Reduce the consumption of natural resources. Reduce the emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere and preserve 
                        the purity of water and forests. In order to curtail climate change and save the glaciers, it is indispensable that global 
                        CO2 emissions be reduced by 45% over the next decade, and that they fall to zero after 2050.

                        Nature-based solutions, such as conserving forests, wetlands and coral reefs, can help communities prepare for, cope with, and 
                        recover from disasters, including slow-onset events such as drought. They can also reduce the secondary impacts from 
                        non-climate-related disasters such as landslides following an earthquake. Forests and other vegetation help stabilise 
                        slopes and therefore reduce the risk of landslides. Wetlands can help regulate floods. Coastal vegetation and natural features 
                        such as sand dunes and mangroves can provide protection from storm surges, strong winds and cyclones. Healthy coral reefs can 
                        reduce wave energy during coastal storms.
